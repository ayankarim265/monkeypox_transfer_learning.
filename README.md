# Monkeypox detection using transfer learning 
The MobileNetV2 model,a efficient convolutional neural network,has been fine-tuned for this task.
Dataset contains a total number of 228 images of which 102 belong to the 'Monkeypox' class and the remaining 126 belong to the 'others' i.e(chickenpox and melases).
result:accuracy is 97.897 and loss is 0.1734 on validation set.
